## Background

This is a challenge completed on Front End Mentor as I'm keen to start building things again from a greenfield perspective

## Solution retrospective

## What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

I'm proud of the cart feature which I used Redux to create, this was a pattern I was keen to reimburse myself in, especially the array functionality to clear and update the cart. On the whole the responsiveness is pretty good, some of the tablet resolutions could be better, I have started to look at designing first in mobile then working my way up to the larger resolutions. I will be using Tailwind going forward and for more challenging projects, I want to start using Typescript.

## What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?

Some of the resolutions, particularly Tablet had some issues within them but I find using the chrome tools to change the css on the fly then adding this to the code was especially useful. Some of the cart and redux functionality was a challenge at the start, remembering to return the items, once they had been through the array function was especially tough as I would get errors as the cart had been emptied, but I didn't understand why.

## What specific areas of your project would you like help with?

None at the moment. I'm happy with the overall outcome.
